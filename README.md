Repository with the background resources for the TFG project: **Creation of a high-pressure turbine design tool**

The final results can be seen in the report document "TFG_FINAL".

Some helpful references can be found:
- Three reference books on gas turbines
- Papers on loss models and correlations
- Papers on turbine design tools and analysis, and additional references

The code is all in the appropriate folder. It is kind of a mess. I apologize.
